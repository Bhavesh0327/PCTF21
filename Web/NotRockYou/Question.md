# Not Rock You

You love to post on the Postbook site but other users keep reporting your posts. The admin is lazy and doesn't check reports frequently. Now you have decided to take matters in your own hands and cancel all reports on your posts. You have brute forced all the password of admin user but you couldn't find it. The server code was leaked somewhere and you can use it for planning your attack. The technician who set up the server must have used really weak passwords considering the leak. The flag is the pasword of admin user.  
PS: Technician likes rock music.
