### Hint for Part 1
Every bit of info given for the case is important.

Google News automatically renders news articles using a certain web technology when a valid article is available.

Google products, including Google Search, serve valid documents of that web technology and their resources from some cache related to the web technology to provide a fast user experience across the mobile web.

Maybe the site behaves differently when this specific cached version of the page is viewed?

### Hint for Part 3
Every bit of metadata provided for the case is important.

There is a service offered by Google for faster browsing within its Android mobile browser Chrome which detects slow speed such as 2G and switches to Google proxy servers with built-in data compression. 

Maybe the site behaves differently when viewed with this service?
