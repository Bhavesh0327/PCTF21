# 1337cod3

1337cod3 is a next-generation coding assessment platform. We use cutting-edge technology to provide a secure and reliable platform to assess candidates for your company.

## Technology

1337cod3 leverages the flexibility and security of WebAssembly to provide a sandboxed environment to test code submitted by candidates. WebAssembly is secure by default and does not require esoteric kernel-level sandboxing to run and test client submitted code in an isolated manner. So, user code is compiled to WebAssembly before execution. Also, since a sandboxed environment can be provided to the candidate, various other types of challenges involving files, randomised datasets for AI/ML challenges can be created to assess the set of candidates.

## Usage

 - Customise the landing page and problem statements in `index.html`
 - Write generators for input and corresponding output in the `problems/testcase.gen.js` file
