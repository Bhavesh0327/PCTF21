Man, I know Louis was useless (Oh, how I wish this was not a "PG Moment", so I could actually curse him), but this time he seems to have completely messed up. I asked him to get me my presentation for the board tomorrow, at today, mere hours before the deadline, he turns up with mediocre content, and worst of all, with none of the projection pictures that I specifically asked him to add.

I am running really late on time here, and there is no way for me to actually finish this thing in time, so, could you help recover me from this mess?
