Hello, recruit. Here to take up your task I see. 

We have managed to procure a zip file from one of our major suspects for the case, who is currently being held at our SECOND biggest base. We have been trying to find out the stuff in it, but our efforts have been futile so far. So, could you maybe help us solve it?
