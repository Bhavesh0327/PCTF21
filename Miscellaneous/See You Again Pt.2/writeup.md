# See You Again Pt.2

There is not much of information we can get from this picture. Immediate reverse search does not seem to work on this.

Since he went on a vacation, we can try to check his Google Calendar for related events; but we can do that only if the calendar is public. The public Google Calendar of a person can be checked from URLs of this format: <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=jakegodfreyb4c43717@gmail.com>
Luckily, his calendar is public and we find the event **'Flight to NZ'**. Thus, we can now narrow down our location to New Zealand.

Linking this with the gigantic clock tower behind and searching for 'clock tower new zealand' we get four locations, out of which [Hopwood Clock Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopwood_Clock_Tower) matches the one in the image. Playing around with the street view for a while in front of that place can fetch us the [right location](https://www.google.com/maps/@-40.3565815,175.6099693,3a,75y,63.56h,79.15t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sUngLukNIl-_MlOyj-e287Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).
